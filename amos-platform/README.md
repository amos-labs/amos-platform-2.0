# amos-platform

Multi-tenant control plane for AMOS. Manages harness lifecycle, billing, governance, and the sync API.

## Binary

```bash
AMOS__DATABASE__URL=postgres://user@localhost:5432/amos_platform_dev \
  AMOS__SERVER__PORT=4000 \
  cargo run --bin amos-platform
# → HTTP: http://localhost:4000, gRPC: localhost:4001
```

## Key Concepts

**Provisioning**: Creates Docker containers for per-customer harness instances via the bollard Docker API. Each harness gets its own postgres database.

**Sync API**: Harness instances periodically heartbeat the platform, pull config updates, and push usage metrics. Supports both managed and self-hosted deployments.

**Billing**: Tracks compute costs with 20% markup for managed deployments. AMOS token holders get discounts. No markup on customer-owned models (sovereign AI).

**Governance**: On-chain proposal creation, voting, and delegation via Solana programs.

**Bounty Service**: Nightly emission distribution -- calculates daily token rewards proportional to contributor points. Optionally submits on-chain proofs to Solana.
